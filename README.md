# Bonga-AI
An AI assistant to help you with the basic tasks. The AI assistant can talk, follow your commands or even chat with you.  
## Install Dependencies:-
1. pip install speechrecognition
2. pip install openai
3. pip install pyaudio
4. pip install pywin32
## Functionality:-
To access all the functionality of the command line AI assistant, Run the main.py file in your IDE.  
1. It can open websites, if you say "Open {website_name}". The more sites can be added in the code.
2. It can answer the questions, if you say "Using artificial intelligence, {prompt}". It is using the OpenAI API KEY to generate the text and the code will create a separate folder to save all the prompts with answers in a .txt file.
3. It can open local music, if you say "Open music". For now, I have added the functionality to play music by its path, but I will work on this for updation.
4. If your command contains "the time", it will tell you the current time.
5. If you say "exit", the program will be terminated.
6. Other than that, if you say any other phrase, it will be chatting with you.
7. You can reset the temporary chat throughout running of that program by saying "Reset chat."
## Conclusion:-
I have implemented the project in the Windows 11 OS. There is more and more functionality to add and make it capable of doing anything. Since it is a command line program, you have to manually run it to use the AI assistant.
